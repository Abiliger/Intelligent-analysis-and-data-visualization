# Intelligent Analysis and Data Visualization
This repository contains my lab works for the university course **Intelligent Analysis and Data Visualization** (2024).  
Each lab explores different techniques in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization using Python.

## ðŸ“š Labs Overview
| â„– | Topic | Description | Tools |
|---|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2** | Data Preprocessing and Correlation Analysis | Cleaned datasets, handled missing values, analyzed correlations between features, and visualized relationships using heatmaps and scatter plots. | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn |
| **3** | Regression Analysis | Built and evaluated linear regression models. Analyzed relationships between dependent and independent variables and visualized regression lines. | Scikit-learn, Matplotlib |
| **4** | Classification (KNN, Decision Tree) | Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree algorithms for supervised learning tasks. Compared models and visualized decision boundaries. | Scikit-learn, Matplotlib |
| **5** | Clustering | Applied unsupervised clustering methods (K-Means and Hierarchical). Visualized clusters and evaluated intra- and inter-cluster distances. | Scikit-learn, Seaborn |
| **6** | Model Evaluation and Metrics | Evaluated classification models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Compared model performance. | Scikit-learn, Pandas |
| **7** | Data Visualization | Created advanced visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatter matrices) to present insights and patterns from datasets. | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **8** | Final Project | Combined all learned techniques: data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization for real-world analysis using Python and Power BI. | Power BI, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) |
| **13** | Hierarchical Clustering | Implemented hierarchical clustering with various linkage methods (Ward, Complete, Average, Single). Visualized dendrograms and compared distance metrics. | SciPy, Scikit-learn |
